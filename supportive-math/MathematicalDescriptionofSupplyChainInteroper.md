Read and Sarah Abowitz</span></p><p class="c38 c22"><span class="c14 c36 c29"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Let a </span><span class="c2 c7">supply chain network (SN) </span><span class="c2">be a collection of people, places, inventory, designs and firms that are generally expressible in the OKF. For example, in response to a hurricane, a single city might create a supply chain network consisting of 5 microfactories, a large supply of raw materials, 25 skilled makers, and 10 trucks owned by the city. Mathematically, one can consider a supply chain network to consist of a set of material suppliers {</span><span class="c2 c7">MS</span><span class="c2 c15">1</span><span class="c2">, ... , </span><span class="c2 c7">MS</span><span class="c2 c7 c15">m</span><span class="c2">}, a set of OKHs {</span><span class="c2 c7">OKH</span><span class="c2 c15">1</span><span class="c2">, ... , </span><span class="c2 c7">OKH</span><span class="c2 c7 c15">n</span><span class="c2">}, a set of OKWs {</span><span class="c2 c7">OKW</span><span class="c2 c15">1</span><span class="c2">, &hellip; , </span><span class="c2 c7">OKW</span><span class="c2 c7 c15">o</span><span class="c2">}, and a set of OKTs {</span><span class="c2 c7">OKT</span><span class="c2 c15">1</span><span class="c2">, &hellip; , </span><span class="c2 c7">OKT</span><span class="c2 c7 c15">p</span><span class="c0">}.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Let a </span><span class="c2 c7">catalog (C) </span><span class="c2">be a set of objects which can potentially be ordered. An important use case of this type is objects for which an OKH is available, although there may be other objects orderable. In general call objects which can be purchased without an OKH </span><span class="c2 c7">normal</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and those that require an OKH </span><span class="c2 c7">adaptive</span><span class="c0">. This language is meant to express that the Open Knowledge Framework allows adaptation to and extension of a normal supply chain network when that normal supply chain network is disrupted or completely inoperable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Let an </span><span class="c2 c7">order (O)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;be both a collection of items chosen from a catalog and a relation mapping said collection to to quantities to be delivered of each item. (Alternatively, an order is a bag or multiset from the catalog.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Let a </span><span class="c2 c7">fulfillment plan</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c2 c7">FP</span><span class="c0">) be a document that maps an order into a supply network&rsquo;s resources and connections between those resources that potentially can fulfill the order. If a supply network changes, it may invalidate a fulfillment plan that depends on said supply chain network. In general, a fulfillment plan references a supplier, an OKH, an OKW, and an OKT. Some fulfillment plans may be degenerate (for example, if a part is consumed in the same place that it is produced, it does not require an OKT.) (Note: Other elements of the Open Knowledge framework, such as OKM, may be referenced by the OKH and thus included by reference or transclusion, but are not directly part of the FP.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A fulfillment plan is composed of a set of </span><span class="c2 c7">stages</span><span class="c2">. In general these stages depend on the OKH that it mentions. Stages are either </span><span class="c2 c7">incomplete</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c2 c7">complete</span><span class="c0">. Each stage is something verifiable as complete by a human being, and may be annotated with documentation of a human assertion. Annotations of this kind should be sufficient to find the human agent that made the assertion of completeness. This level of documentation does not exist to assign blame or responsibility, but to take corrective action if the fulfillment plan is broken or if the assertion is later found to be inaccurate. The stages for a given object may be created from the OKH, or maybe generically created by the platform.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In general, a fulfillment plan moves from a state of unfulfillment to being fulfilled by means of stages being completed. Stages are related by a partial order relation, and when two stages are related in this way, we say one stage </span><span class="c2 c7">depends on </span><span class="c2">another. Generally if stage </span><span class="c2 c7">y</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;depends on stage </span><span class="c2 c7">x</span><span class="c2">, it would be unusual for </span><span class="c2 c7">y</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to be complete and </span><span class="c2 c7">x</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to be incomplete, although there is nothing preventing a human from asserting that </span><span class="c2 c7">y</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is complete. This partial order creates a directed acyclic graph of stages called a </span><span class="c2 c7">stage graph</span><span class="c0">. The ability to visually render this graph and its state of completeness is a useful feature of the platform.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A stage graph is a convenient object against which to perform a risk analysis. This may be considered a form of abstract interpretation as the term is used in programming language theory. For example, each stage could be annotated with a probability of (independent) failure at that node. The conditional probability of the fulfillment failing may then be computed directly from the independent probabilities of specific atomic failures. Because the probabilities of a stage failing may be highly time dependent, we can easily imagine different risk analyses based on different times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A triple consisting of an order, fulfillment plan, and supply chain network </span><span class="c2 c7">(o, fp, sn)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is a fundamental object supported by our platform. We may assume that an order, a supply network, and a fulfillment plan are implied by a dynamic supply chain and informally refer to this triple as a </span><span class="c2 c7">dynamic supply chain (D)</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Let a </span><span class="c2 c7">platform </span><span class="c2">sbe a semi-automated software system which, with the aid of humans, allows dynamic supply chains to be constructed and manipulated for the purpose of filling orders which actually deliver needed goods to people, even in the presence of supply chain disruptions. In actual practice, a supply chain network will be supporting a large number of dynamic supply chains at any one point in time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A dynamic supply chain </span><span class="c2 c7">D</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is a mutable object which evolves over time, particularly as stages are completed. Dynamic supply chains may be indefinite, capturing the notion of continuous supply of some item across time, or definite in time, capturing the notion of an order being fulfilled and now closed. In order to understand the change of a dynamic supply chain over time, a dynamic supply chain has a history, which may be thought of as a function of the supply chain and time </span><span class="c2 c7">t </span><span class="c2">which expresses the changes in a supply chain over time, which may be represented (H(D,t)). &nbsp;A dynamic supply chain which utilizes an element of an OKF is called </span><span class="c2 c7">adaptive</span><span class="c2">. A dynamic supply chain which does not utilize the OKF is called </span><span class="c2 c7">normal</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dynamic supply chains have the fundamental property of being recursively composable, as expressed in an example below where a dynamic supply chain for a chair is a composition of the dynamic supply chains for a back, a seat, and four legs. This composability fundamentally occurs at the stage we might call &ldquo;delivery&rdquo;. That is, if a part fundamentally relies on other parts, the delivery of those other parts may be considered an independent dynamic supply chain which is referenceable. Therefore, the dynamic supply chain for a chair may include by reference the dynamic supply chain for the seat. Although we may look at dynamic supply chains at different scales, for different purposes, we generally focus on the top-level dynamic supply chain which provides something useful to an end consumer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A </span><span class="c2 c7">contract</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;specifies a buyer and a dynamic supply chain. A contract may be </span><span class="c2 c7">potential</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c2 c7">agreed upon/signed</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c2 c7">contested</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c2 c7">completed</span><span class="c0">. We make no attempt to formalize the terms of the contract. Although contracts are very necessary for human cooperation, automating them is not necessarily to create a platform which provides useful supply chain interoperability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this sense, a dynamic supply chain is the fundamental data object that our platform and Open Knowledge Framework treats. &nbsp;Our proposed platform supports a number of functions listed below. It must be understood that at first, many of these functions are implemented with the assistance of real human beings solving real problems and making human judgements. Nonetheless, this is an organizing framework which should make supply chains more resilient. The framework may evolve through greater automation over time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we think of the platform as a computer program, it is similar to a database management system storing objects that are related to dynamic supply chains. However, it must provide some fundamental computational operations as well, and alongside those, some definitions of their set theory equivalents:</span></p><ul class="c16 lst-kix_a4mjknnh0bzw-0 start"><li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Compute the catalog of objects which can potentially be ordered. Ideally, this catalog would distinguish between those that clearly cannot be ordered at present due to a supply chain disruption, and those which can. However, as this may be computationally difficult, we imagine the catalog being presented along with guidance which is not guaranteed to be complete.</span></li></ul><ul class="c16 lst-kix_a4mjknnh0bzw-1 start"><li class="c1 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c4">The set theory expression of this operation is F</span><span class="c2 c15 c4">O </span><span class="c2 c4">: (</span><span class="c2 c24">C, SN</span><span class="c2 c4">)</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&#10236; </span><span class="c2 c11">C</span><span class="c2 c3">1</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;.</span></li><li class="c1 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">For every item in catalog </span><span class="c2 c24">C</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c2 c4">F</span><span class="c2 c15 c4">Order </span><span class="c2">recursively checks against each element of the item that supply chain network </span><span class="c2 c24">SN </span><span class="c2">can reliably supply or make.

The big question in my mind now is if we should continue working at this level (a math-y level) or if we should work at a class-y level in Python. I&rsquo;m going to try to understand Sage Math in Python a bit more before I make this decision. The work below is a good start. As a &ldquo;theory&rdquo; (in this sense of a collection of theorems, not in the sense of a question to be answered) it is weak because it presents no theorems. I also believe the symbol F is a big over used. Also I prefer not to use color because it is not supported by LaTeX and standard mathematical practice (I would prefer to use subscripts and different fonts to accomplish the intended distinctions.)]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[BIGGER NOTE from Rob: This work of Sarah&rsquo;s was influential in the Python code that I wrote.

If we consider how an OKF-augmented supply network differs from a standard supply network, it seems that the fundamental action in an acute crisis is likely to be different:</span></p><ol class="c16 lst-kix_hts3vcx987qb-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Because OKF suppliers are new and probably untrusted, we expect more communication and more negotiation.</span></li><li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Because OKF suppliers may not be able to produce their own supply network of fundamental inputs to an OKH they can produce, deciding how to obtain those fundamental inputs becomes a computational problem that someone must solve.</span></li><li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Because the OKF is expected to be of greater value in an acute crisis, we expect the computation of price to depend on the price of inputs, and the OKH-impelmentor may have no more knowledge of these prices than the Buyer.</span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, a fundamental operation is to produce a &ldquo;negotiation frame&rdquo; based on an OKH. The frame contains the contact information of all parties that most participate in the OKH: the maker, the suppliers of the inputs, and the buyer. This frame can then be used by either the maker or the buyer to understand prices and negotiate actual contracts allowing the delivery of the good to the buyer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, suppose there is no supply of ready-made chairs, but an OKH for a chair exists. The fundamental inputs (at the first level of recursion only) to a chair are 1 seat, 1 back, and 4 legs. &nbsp;Let us assume that the supply network can provide seats, backs, and legs. The fundamental things a person who needs chairs wants to know are:</span></p><ol class="c16 lst-kix_kepipaxjhzha-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Who do I talk to to order a chair?</span></li><li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Who do I talk to to order the inputs?</span></li><li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Although the price may not be known and may be negotiable, what is the price structure?</span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In turns out the price of a chair can be understood as an equation:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">P = 4 * L + 1 * B + 1 * S + K = K + 4L + B + S,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where L is the price of a leg, B is the price of a back, S is the price of a seat, and K is a constant representing the price of the labor of assembly. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s name such equations the &ldquo;characteristic pricing equation&rdquo; of the fulfillment plan. Although all of these may be negotiable, the platform can give contact information for all of the people who can determine these prices with negotiation. So providing that info and the equation above is a fundamental operation. The Weave function does not technically have to produce the characteristic pricing equation because they can be computed from a fulfillment plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If more than one OKH is required (for example, nobody is supplying Legs but instructions for woodturning maple boards into legs are available), then naturally this becomes recursive. That is, an OKH may need an OKH to get a fundamental input. The characteristic pricing equation can be updated by simple algebraic substitution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is some opportunity for tiny amounts of linear algebra in this. If we think of the price of all basic inputs (fundamental inputs not created by OKHs) as a vertical vector P of length N and the number of distinct goods purchased in an order by M, then we can compose the characteristic equations into an M-row, N-column matrix Q. The price of the order is a vertical vector of length M defined by the matrix multiplication of Q x P. &nbsp;(The total price is the L1-norm or simple sum of P.) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although elegant, this has limited utility, because in general Weave should produce multiple plans for obtaining a given good. Until a plan is chosen, the matrix approach cannot be used by simple multiplication (it can still form a useful &ldquo;table&rdquo; however.) However, if one sets aside the multiple plan problem, then one can even form a &ldquo;Price Jacobian&rdquo; as a matrix which gives the change in price of the final good as a function of the change in price of the input fundamental commodities.

This is especially true in a disrupted supply network, when the fundamental assumption of perfect market knowledge is unlikely to hold. Therefore any discussion of pricing will be somewhat academic. Nevertheless the characteristic pricing equations remain useful as an incontrovertible minimum price.</span></p><h3 class="c17 c19" id="h.qahb0035u5mo"><span class="c10">On Continuous vs. Discrete Pricing</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the advantages of the characteristic pricing equation is that it delays making a decision if prices are treated as continuous or discrete. For example, many firms wish to establish a supply chain that constantly, continuously, and smoothly delivers goods. In such a situation demand and supply need not be measured in absolute units but as rates---units per unit time. For example, ventilators per day. A given firm may only be able to make 2.7 ventilators per day. The fact that a fraction of a ventilator is nonsense is irrelevant so long as the orders are large and long-duration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Discrete pricing, on the other hand, imagines the fulfillment plan as executing a single operation and then stopping.</span></p><p class="c1 c22"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note: Our current OKF probably does not assign unique enough identifiers of the &ldquo;type&rdquo; of the good.

Let us suppose that a given microfactory allows the construction of a dynamic supply chain (</span><span class="c2 c7">L</span><span class="c2">). For the time being, assume this is elementary&ndash;that we need not consider what goes into making legs, but can trust that our supply chain network provides a factory that can make legs. An order </span><span class="c2 c7">O</span><span class="c2">(</span><span class="c2 c7">L</span><span class="c0">) can create a dynamic supply chain that delivers legs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Likewise, if we can make a seat (</span><span class="c2 c7">S</span><span class="c2">) and a back (</span><span class="c2 c7">B</span><span class="c2">), we can compose instances of these three objects to make a chair (</span><span class="c2 c7">C</span><span class="c2">).

In actual practice, a dynamic supply chain would likely be deeper. However, we can generally compose dynamic supply chains in tree-like fashion of expanding depth. &nbsp;The function </span><span class="c2 c7">A</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is not quite so simple as a pure union of subsets, but we can usefully pretend this is so to organize a dynamic supply chain. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we discuss the completeness of dynamic supply chains below, we mention the concept of a property such as being free of the allergen latex.

A supply network which allows this substitution is generally more resilient than one which does not. Even if it requires human judgment, a recursive structure is more comprehensible when explaining such modularity to others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For example, let us suppose that a buyer has used the platform to generate a dynamic supply chain for a chair and the order has been placed. The platform formally tracks this status of </span><span class="c2 c7">O</span><span class="c2">(</span><span class="c2 c7">C</span><span class="c2">) = </span><span class="c2 c7">A</span><span class="c2">(4</span><span class="c2 c7">O</span><span class="c2">(</span><span class="c2 c7">L</span><span class="c2">) &#8899; </span><span class="c2 c7">O</span><span class="c2">(</span><span class="c2 c7">S</span><span class="c2">) &#8899; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c7">O</span><span class="c2">(</span><span class="c2 c7">B</span><span class="c0">)) as &ldquo;placed&rdquo;. The order is a witness to the agreement of the parties to build and deliver a chair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Now, suppose there is a supply network rupture, and the manufacturer of seats cannot fulfill their part of the order. However, there is a seat </span><span class="c2 c7">S</span><span class="c2 c15">1</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in the catalog. We do not imagine that </span><span class="c2 c7">S</span><span class="c2 c15">1</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;can be substituted for </span><span class="c2 c7">S</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;without human approval, but the order allows the means for one to ask the buyer if </span><span class="c2 c7">S</span><span class="c28 c15">1</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is an acceptable replacement to </span><span class="c2 c7">S</span><span class="c0">, and for one to record said answer. The resilience of the supply network improves as more components, such as seats, are added to the OKF.</span></p><h2 class="c34" id="h.kfsq5luxrzl0"><span class="c14 c33 c29">On Mathematical Composability of Supply Chains</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Let </span><span class="c2 c7">modularity</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;be the replacement of one object for another. </span><span class="c2 c7">Composability</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a more powerful concept: it is the ability to rearrange the relationships between objects. The platform supports the composability of dynamic supply chains, but not objects. For example, we might have a supply network comprising three microfactories, one making legs, one making seats, and one making backs. However, if one of these is removed from the supply network by a mishap such as a flood, we must now compose a dynamic supply chain using only two factories. Some factories will have to make more than one kind of component if we are to fulfill an order for chairs. However, this is possible and anticipated by factories that can process a wide variety of OKHs.</span></p><h1 class="c43 c51" id="h.e76x5xxx5igl"><span class="c14 c18">Composability and Completeness of Orders and Dynamic Supply Chains</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A </span><span class="c2 c7">interoperable dynamic supply chain</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is created when someone establishes a platform that uses the OKF. Such a dynamic supply chain can be thought of as the elements that fulfill an order. For example, one can easily imagine an OKH being created very quickly in response to an emergency which is quite specifically tailored to ensure the device is manufactured in a way that meets FDA requirements, whether those are long-standing or were created acutely through an Emergency Use Authorization. An order is </span><span class="c2 c7">complete</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;when there is verifiable evidence that a dynamic supply chain can fulfill the order. Although this evidence may be automated in some cases, it will generally consist of recorded human assertions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">If we consider a general order purchasable from the catalog presented by the platform, the object will automatically have quality assurance built into the OKH, instructing how to build and verify it. However, suppose that the buyer purchases new requirements or criteria on the order, such as that it be latex-free or nickel-free, which is not already a part of the OKH. &nbsp;A human being can create evidence that the object is allergen-free by checking the OKMs of all the ingredients that comprise the object. This evidence, in combination with the rest of the OKHs&rsquo; tests, may make this order </span><span class="c2 c7">complete </span><span class="c0">in the context of a dynamic supply chain which can provide all the components necessary to fulfill the order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Checking for completeness of orders and composing orders which are complete is the primary executable function of the platform. We may expect this evidence to be generally correct, but occasionally humans make errors. In that case, the order will not be properly fulfilled; however, the failure is any understood in the context of the traceability of the error. The OKF and traceability provide all the information necessary to track the problem down and fix it. For example, the evidence that no sub-component contains nickel could have been made erroneously even though a sub-component clearly states that it contains nickel, or alternatively, a component may contain nickel while erroneously stating that it is nickel-free. There may be other failure modes, but the platform, the dynamic supply chain, and the OKF, provide means of addressing the problem. The order, although not fulfilled, still represents a useful correctable plan for its fulfillment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Physical objects produced by the OKF are </span><span class="c2 c7">composable</span><span class="c0">. Often to supply an object dynamically, a supply chain must supply several components. Each of these components may be thought of as requiring an order fulfillment against a dynamic supply chain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A quality criterion can be </span><span class="c2 c7">recursively verifiable </span><span class="c0">by being verified by each dynamic supply chain which makes a part of a product. Freedom from allergens is such an example; if all components are allergen free, the product is allergen free. In general, however, each quality criterion is not so easy to satisfy with simple evidence. Nonetheless, the OKF provides at least a framework for providing evidence of completeness. For example, suppose that two materials are heat-bonded into a mask. The platform likely has clear quality controls on each material separately, but is not expected to be able to assert that they can be heated in contact without producing a toxic byproduct. However, a human being can provide this evidence at the level of the final product (which may be only a sub-product from the buyer&rsquo;s point of view.) This framework thus provides an evidentiary record of the completeness and satisfaction of all criteria, even though this is not fully automatable and is subject to human judgment and error.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An order can be thought of as a sentence or expression in an informal language, which can be checked for completeness by checking that the platform and dynamic supply chain and assembly processes can provide a product which meets all criteria. A provably complete order is a good candidate for fulfillment. Although quality, production capability, and ability to finance the operation are all required to complete the order, it may be useful to separate these concerns. For example, an order may be complete, yet also rely on a manufacturer of a sub-component in a microfactory with no established reputation. The buyer may then hesitate because they are not convinced that every needed component can be reliably supplied by the dynamic supply chain. This unreliability is partially addressed by the fungibility of resources provided by the OKF. If an agile, dynamic supply chain is established, one manufacturer may indeed be statistically unreliable, not because of quality but simple failure to execute obligations. However, the OKF provides inherent resilience in that the unreliable party is not the only party which is capable of making the subpart, by definition. Although a failure of one supplier may delay a specific order, the order can be successfully completed by other suppliers from the OKF. Thus the OKF allows resilient, composable dynamic supply chains to be established which allow orders to be checked for completeness, and provide the ability to trace and recover from failures of the platform.</span></p><h2 class="c34" id="h.3ksoy7ux7990"><span class="c14 c33 c29">(DRAFT) Formalization of Fragility</span></h2><p class="c1 c22"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note: The following assumes price affects neither supply nor demand.
