# Open-Knowledge-Framework for Supply Chain Interoperability Specification

Please see the [Overview](/overview) and the [Green Paper](/HEGreenPaperSCISv3)

## Collaboration

The Green Paper is authored using Google Docs and published on this site via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
As such, we will not be accepting pull requests to update the document.
Please open [an issue](https://github.com/helpfulengineering/OKF-SCIS/issues) with suggested changes.
If the changes are accepted, a member of the SCIS team will update the Google doc and republish the updated document here.

The publishing process is straightforward.
We are investigating automating the process, but for now these are the manual steps to publish an update:

1. Download the green paper from Google Docs in HTML format via the "File" -> "Download" -> "Web Page (.html, zipped)" menu item
2. Unzip the archive into the root of the locally cloned SCIS repo
3. Commit changes, either directly to main branch or via a pull request
4. That's it! GitHub pages will automatically update the website with the updated files

> Note, the HTML version of the SCIS green paper is currently published to the `devhawk/html` branch.
> GitHub pages is also configured to publish that branch on the web.
> Once the repo + green paper file names have been finalized, the changes will be merged into `main` branch 
> and GitHub Pages configuration will be updated.
